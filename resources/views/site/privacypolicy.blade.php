<h5>8. DATA BREACH</h5>

You will be notified about data breaches when Virtual Chicago ARTCC believes you are likely to be at risk or serious harm. For example, a data breach may be likely to result in serious financial harm or harm to your mental or physical well-being. In the event that Virtual Chicago ARTCC becomes aware of a security breach which has resulted or may result in unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information Virtual Chicago ARTCC will promptly investigate the matter and notify the applicable Supervisory Authority not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.</p>



<h5>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h5>

<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.
